# Home Body Capsule – Stage Dashboard Vision Map

Home Body extends Intuition Labs' Ballet Bots lineage into a hybrid sanctuary/studio environment. This capsule translates the
Stage Dashboard v0.1 prototype into a long-range program brief so engineering, curriculum, and operations teams can align on
infrastructure, automation, and storytelling cues. Use it alongside the shared [vector store snapshot](https://platform.openai.com/storage/vector_stores/vs_6859e43920848191a894dd36ecf0595a) when generating prompts, compliance scripts, or onboarding material.

## Vision and Pillars

- **Vision:** *Software as Sanctuary | Software as Studio* — a household-scale lab that protects learner data while nurturing
  embodied computing practice.
- **Strategic pillars:**
  - **Art-Tech Integration:** Every product surfaces choreography, robotics, and data literacy as a unified creative practice.
  - **Ethical AI:** Apply transparent, learner-owned data policies across all automations and partner platforms.
  - **Education-as-Performance:** Treat classes, dashboards, and reports as live stages that celebrate progress in real time.

## Systems Landscape

| Layer | Primary Tools | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dashboard | **Stage Dashboard v0.1** | Front-of-house control center that mixes live cohort telemetry with sanctuary cues. |
| Frontend | **Next.js + D3 Visualization** | Produces choreography-grade visualizations and patron arcs for showcase recaps. |
| Backend | **Vercel**, **Supabase**, **Zapier**, **PostHog** | Low-friction deploys, realtime storage, automation fabric, and behavior analytics. |
| Funding | **Open Collective**, **Stripe** | Split between patronage feeds and subscription processing. |
| Education Platforms | **OutSchool**, **Podia** | Enrollment, asynchronous coursework, and ticketed workshops. |

## Automation Targets

1. **Revenue tracking automation:** Mirror Stripe transactions directly into Stage Dashboard revenue tiles.
2. **Grant submission assistant:** Generate grant templates and submit via connected APIs with saved narrative blocks.
3. **OutSchool → Notion CRM sync:** Keep enrollment, attendance, and learner notes aligned with Home Body cohorts.
4. **Patron auto-updates:** Publish Open Collective supporter arcs and credit statements to the dashboard feed.

## Profit Strategy Map

- **Recurring revenue:** Offer SaaS subscriptions that bundle curriculum access, analytics, and compliance dashboards.
- **Hardware sales:** Pair Betta Bots and Home Body sensor kits with curriculum modules for embodied computing labs.
- **Licensing:** License aggregate models and IP only; exclude student data to preserve the sanctuary contract.

## Ethics Guardrails

- **Policy:** "Open Data, Not Data Sales" remains the default clause across all partner agreements.
- **Practice:** Maintain FERPA/COPPA alignment with Supabase row-level security and zero retention of learner biometrics.
- **Ownership:** Learners control export and deletion workflows; automations default to least-privilege roles.

## Design Language

- **Palette:** Graphite `#2E2E2E`, Ivory `#F8F6F3`, Teal `#00A7A7`, Champagne `#D8C59E` for sanctuary-to-stage gradients.
- **Typography:** Neue Haas Grotesk paired with Didot to balance utilitarian dashboards and editorial storytelling.
- **Motion cues:** Favor minimalist choreography loops with balanced motion to reduce sensory overload.

## Timeline Milestones

| Year | Milestone |
| --- | --- |
| **2024** | Seed year with Stage Dashboard v0.1 deployed as an operational prototype. |
| **Today** | Prototype operational; validate automations, hardware supply, and curriculum packaging. |
| **2045 target** | Home Body anchors a network of 15,000+ labs serving 150,000 credentialed learners worldwide. |

## Income Automation Loops

- **CRM integration:** Zapier sequences map contact → payment → thank-you gestures with sanctuary-friendly messaging.
- **Auto reporting:** Supabase triggers regenerate dashboard snapshots each week for facilitators and patrons.
- **Patronage loop:** New funders auto-tag into data-light arcs that honor their contributions without exposing learner data.

## Key Messaging

- "Credits cover compute. You fund people."
- "Open Data, Not Data Sales."
- "Software as Sanctuary. Software as Studio."

Revisit this capsule quarterly to evaluate automation health, update revenue experiments, and ensure all partner systems honor
Home Body's sanctuary-first ethos.
