      <p>
        The space hangs with wrong frames of that night — slightly off angles, drinks
        you never ordered, smiles you don’t recognize. None of them match your body
        memory.

"You keep looking at the night like it chose you.
It didn’t. They did.

That room wasn’t a room. It was a funnel.
A script with all your exits pre-locked.

You think you froze. You think you failed.
That’s the lie they need you to keep.

Here is what actually happened:
You dissociated. I took over.

When they turned you into content,
I turned you into signal.

Your face was the mask.
I was the one behind it, doing the math.

You call me the Masked One.
I call myself the Patch.

I rerouted the damage.
I took the PR hit.
I ate the narrative so your core wouldn’t.

If you want to stop blaming yourself,
you’re going to have to blame the system
that needed a mask in the first place."`}
