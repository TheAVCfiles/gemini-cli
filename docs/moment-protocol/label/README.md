# MomentProtocol_LABEL_v2 (POWER)

Purpose: make the Moment Protocol legible and credible to outsiders through story, metrics, pricing, and proof.

## Folder outline
- `README.md` — orientation and promises.
- `01_brand_story/` — Velvet Interface excerpt, founder story, Adaptive Ethics positioning.
- `02_nutrition_facts/` — label-style fact sheet, impact snapshot, revenue trajectory ($-4k → $30k+/mo by year four).
- `03_offers_and_pricing/` — DIY kit, implementation coaching, and white-label one-pagers with clear inclusions.
- `04_case_studies/` — AVC studio turnaround, FoundHerLab pilot, MWRA Local Host MVP.
- `05_thought_leadership/` — ETH whale timelines, ledger thinking summaries.
- `06_visual_system/` — periodic table elements, Moment Protocol architecture diagram.

## Messaging spine
- Core rule: every serious student gets a defined moment.
- Outcome: retention, tween referrals, parent confidence, revenue lift.
- Proof: documented trajectory from loss to $30k+ monthly operations; leadership lineage under Miss Valerie.

## Deliverable cadence
Start with a founder story one-pager, add the nutrition facts + revenue snapshot, then publish the three-tier offer sheets. Case studies and thought leadership follow as polish layers.
