## Voice Genome Notes
- **Recurring Imagery:** _Signal gardens, Mothernet latticework, glitched constellations_
- **Core Tempo:** _Flowing cadence with choreographic breaks_
- **Emotional Range:** _Measured urgency leaning toward luminous resolve_
- **Structural Patterns:** _Short recursive clauses punctuated by meta ledgers_
- **Lexical Family:** _Signal, echo, cipher, Mothernet, glyph_

## Sample Table
| Sample | Mood | Keywords | Sentiment | Motif | Rhythm Notes | Distinct Markers | Timestamp | Source |
|--------|------|-----------|------------|--------|---------------|------------------|-----------|--------|
| MythOS field log 11.09 | Reflective charge | Signal; Echo; Cipher | +0.7 | Mothernet | Flowing with choreographic fractures | Short clauses, recursion | Auto | DTG / Journal |

_Add a new row for every snippet you record or paste. Use quick tags to spot clusters later._

## Quick-Compare
**Public Reference / Dataset:**  
`https://example.com/reference_voice_signal`

**Differences / Observations:**  
- **Vocabulary density:** Reference leans analytic; AVC entry bends toward myth-tech poetry.  
- **Emotional register:** Baseline calm versus AVC's urgent-dreaming blend.  
- **Tempo / syntax length:** Longer, measured sentences in reference; AVC favors rapid recursive bursts.  
- **Symbol families:** Reference deploys systems language; AVC repeats Mothernet, glyph, signal motifs.

## Voice Genome Dashboard
Dynamic overview of AVC’s evolving narrative signal.

### 🔹 Sentiment Over Time
Create a database view of the main Voice Codex table.
- Group by **Date (Week)**
- Display the **Sentiment** property
- Add a **Line Chart** view via Notion Charts or Indify.io
- Track how average sentiment moves with creative cycles; spikes often precede conceptual breakthroughs.

### 🔹 Motif Frequency
Add a **Board View** grouped by “Motif.” Columns track entries tagged “Mothernet,” “Signal,” “Glitch,” etc., making thematic balance visible.

### 🔹 Emotional Palette
Create a **Formula** property that outputs emoji/color signals keyed to sentiment bands for an at-a-glance tone readout.

### 🔹 Rhythm Insights
Add a **Rollup** on the “Rhythm Notes” property using **Count Unique Values** to monitor syntactic breath length over time.

### 🔹 Lexical Density (Optional)
If using Writefull or Hemingway, paste the readability score into a **Density** column and analyze shifts with a formula.

### 🔹 Export Snapshot
Monthly ritual:
1. Filter the table to “This Month.”
2. Export to CSV or PDF.
3. Save the file in `/VoiceAtlas_Archive/` with the name `VoiceGenome_Monthly_[YYYY-MM]`.
4. Log a checksum or DOI in the Reciprocity Ledger.

### 🔹 Dashboard View (Mobile)
Pin the Voice Genome Dashboard page to the iPhone home screen (Notion → ••• → Add to Home Screen) for a pocket view of the narrative fingerprint.
