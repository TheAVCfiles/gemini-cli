# Vision & Positioning

AVC Studio builds privacy-first, myth-tech studio OSes for creators and survivor-centered networks. Our product marries choreographic, poetic UX (PoetUX) with robust cryptographic provenance, offline-first collaboration, and a studio governance layer.

Positioning:
- Audience: independent studios, creators, creative collectives, survivor support networks.
- Problem: creators’ IP is captured or misused; studios lack ledgered credentials and repeatable procedures.
- Solution: Local-first Studio OS with encrypted provenance, ledgered StageCred, and grant/product automation.
