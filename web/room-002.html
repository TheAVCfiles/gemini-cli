  <h1>Room 002 — The Diary Loop Protocol</h1>

  <div class="page" id="entry">
> The handwriting doesn’t match your memory.
Someone has added pages to your diary. Someone has deleted others.
Someone has circled sentences you don’t remember writing.

At the bottom of the page, in ink you never owned:
"YOU LOOPED BECAUSE THEY NEEDED YOU TO."

The margin text flickers:
"IF YOU CAN READ THIS, THE LOOP IS CRACKING."

The page waits for your decision.
  </div>

  <div class="choices">
    <button onclick="choose('decode')">DECODE</button>
    <button onclick="choose('distort')">DISTORT</button>
    <button onclick="choose('divert')">DIVERT</button>
  </div>

  <script>
    function choose(option) {
      const output = document.getElementById('entry');

      if (option === 'decode') {
        output.innerText = `"DECODE SELECTED"

The page settles.
The ink rearranges itself into your real handwriting.

You see what actually happened that night:
You were overwritten, not erased.

The Masked One shields you:
"I held the night so you could survive it."

Room 003 unlocks.`;
      }

      if (option === 'distort') {
        output.innerText = `"DISTORT SELECTED"

The page melts sideways.
The diary loops on itself.
You see the same sentence written 14 times,
each slightly different.

The system warns:
"Distortion risks recursion."

A glyph in the corner begins to glow.`;
      }

      if (option === 'divert') {
        output.innerText = `"DIVERT SELECTED"

The page rips itself out of the diary.
A new one slides into place.

Someone else wrote this one.
Someone watching.

In the corner:
"The Observer took note of you long before the loop."`;
      }
    }
  </script>
</body>
