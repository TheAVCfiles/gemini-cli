# SYVAQ Deliverable Bundle

This directory hosts the deliverables requested for the SYVAQ "DeCrypt the Future" engagement. Each file is copy-ready and mirrors the artifacts deposited in `/mnt/data/syvaq` for direct download.

## Contents

- `Client-Delivery-Blueprint-Syvaq.md` — Service packages, SOPs, and guardrails.
- `Notion-Syvaq-Workspace.md` — Notion workspace scaffolding.
- `MOU-Syvaq-Allison.md` — Beta mentorship agreement template.
- `Anaretic_Checklist.md` — Daily/weekly Guardian protocol reference.
- `README-Plug-Founding-Time.md` — Operational instructions for finalizing astro runs.
- `Founding-Datetime-Template.md` — YAML + RAG workflow for capturing founding moment data.
- `Founding-Moment-Interpretation-template.md` — Narrative interpretation template for the founding chart.
- `29_protocol_engine.py` — Placeholder astro engine script with deterministic sample data.
- `sample/lilly_syvaq_astro_series_placeholder.csv` — Ten-day sample output for demos.

## Usage Notes

1. Update `<<FOUNDING_DATETIME>>` placeholders once the verified timestamp is available.
2. Run `29_protocol_engine.py` after inserting verified datetimes to regenerate outputs.
3. Import the CSV into the Notion **Astro Engine** database and link to Delivery Project tasks.
4. Feed the YAML + interpretation templates into the local RAG assistant to keep the founding record synchronized across systems.

The same files are available for download at `/mnt/data/syvaq/` inside this environment.
