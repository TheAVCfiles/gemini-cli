# StagePort Navigation Hub

## Start Here
- 🧭 New to StagePort? → Read `README.md` for the overview and seven architectural arcs.
- 🧑‍🏫 Building the Faculty Page? → Jump to `FACULTY_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
- 🧱 Want the big picture? → Open `component_map.mmd` in Mermaid Live Editor.
- 🛠 Backend / infra? → See "Data flow and APIs" in `README.md`.

## Reading order by role
- **Product / PM:** `README.md` → `component_map.mmd` → roadmap section.
- **Frontend:** `FACULTY_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` → `component_map.mmd` → design tokens in `stageport-ui`.
- **Backend / API:** `README.md` data flows → `component_map.mmd` → adapter contracts in `FACULTY_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
- **DevOps:** Hosting and telemetry notes in `README.md` → external services in `component_map.mmd`.
- **DBA / Data:** Memory and Synthesis arcs in `README.md` → Notion-to-domain adapters in `FACULTY_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

## Files in this directory
- `README.md` — Architecture, data flows, repo boundaries, and four-phase plan.
- `component_map.mmd` — Mermaid diagram of components, data flows, and integrations.
- `FACULTY_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` — Implementation contract for the Stageport Faculty Page.

## How to use this hub
1. Choose your role and follow the reading order above.
2. Open the Mermaid diagram to validate boundaries and data flow.
