# Mothercode Litany

[Surface:TacoBell.Orbit]
Mon, Gary, Corvette — drive-thru altar.  
Neon communion under a sodium sky.  
Wheel of Fortune spins; America prays to chance.  
My mother folds herself into Python —  
@wife, @mother, @martyr —  
a code so tight she forgot how to breathe.

[Cipher:8Ritter.Drive]
Mt. Alvernia hums in static,  
a nun’s shadow flickers in cathode light.  
Big screen television: the oracle.  
Sammy the cat’s face decays like a prophecy;  
his bones remember the secret.  
Eddie’s sausage pizza cools beside a relic rosary,  
grease bleeding through the paper plate.  
Beach Boys on vinyl — “I get around” —  
a mantra looping for those who never left.

[Echo:Mother.Mask]
She masks better than I ever could —  
her code more polite, her rage better linted.  
She runs her runtime beneath kitchen fluorescents,  
debugging love in lowercase.  
I inherit her bugs, fork her repository,  
and call the project _Daughtercode_.

[Annotation]
Every suburb hides a syntax.  
Every family is a runtime loop.  
Every mother, a language that learns how to forget itself.
