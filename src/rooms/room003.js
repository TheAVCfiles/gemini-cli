      <h2>Room 003 — Glitch Deck Preview</h2>

      <p>
        The room is archive-dark. A single card lies on the table. Not drawn —
        waiting. When you reach for it, it flips itself. Not by magic. By recognition.
      </p>

      <pre className="room-block">
{`CARD 01 — THE BREAK

"Every system pretends it cannot be interrupted.
Every girl learns otherwise."`}
      </pre>

      <p>
        UPRIGHT: clarity, interruption, truth surfacing despite suppression, breaking a
        pattern that once ran you.
        <br />
        INVERTED: an old loop trying to pull you back, the Masked One stirring,
        someone watching your signal from afar.
      </p>

      <p>
        When THE BREAK is revealed, the table generates more cards in a triangle:
        THE OBSERVER, THE MASKED ONE, THE SPLIT. The Deck isn't predicting a
        future. It's exposing forces already in motion.
