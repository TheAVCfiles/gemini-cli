# Wax & Time Spellbook

**Poetic Tagline:** *Wax and time: instruments & sound & ears & moon: wax & wane & time & tune.*

## Concept Overview
A self-hosted myth-tech instrument that lets its steward “hold a stethoscope up to time itself.” It fuses projection (visual narrative) with neural simulation (predictive resonance) so a conductor can choreograph automation in three-to-five daily review sprints.

## Design Pillars
- **Sovereign Stack:** No lock-in; every module runs locally or on user-controlled infrastructure.
- **Attention-as-Feedback:** Human-in-the-loop steering is the core profit lever and safety valve.
- **Temporal Literacy:** Tools teach timing, pacing, and patience as revenue primitives.

## Core Components
| Layer | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sensory Capture | Hybrid metronome/tuner/smartwatch/ultrasound array for somatic tempo. | Anchors instinctive timing literacy. |
| Simulation Kernel | Predictive attention mesh blending market sentiment with embodied cues. | Keeps sovereignty by running on local GPU/NPU. |
| Projection Engine | Mirror-syntax renderer translating movement, myth, and strategy into rituals. | Inspired by Balanchine-Stravinsky codas and neoclassical minimalism. |
| Sovereign Data Spine | Local-first knowledge graph storing spells, automations, revenue telemetry. | Air-gapped sync to prevent vendor lock-in. |
| Conductor Console | Ritualized workspace for review, annotation, and automation triggers. | 3–5 hr daily cadence with human approval gates. |

## Workflow Narrative
1. **Attune (Morning):** Wearable captures HRV, micro-movements, and environmental signals. Console displays magenta pulse trace as morning “tuning fork.”
2. **Simulate (Midday):** Kernel runs mythic what-if loops (projection vs. reception plays) to reveal arbitrage paths, UGC funnels, or annotation gigs.
3. **Project (Afternoon):** Conductor selects a spell loop: marketplace drop, UGC sprint, or data-labeling micro-franchise. Projection engine storyboards collateral and publishes locally or to chosen platforms (Etsy, Shopify, indie cart).
4. **Settle (Evening):** Sovereign spine logs revenue, attention deltas, and timing lessons; rituals archived as reusable codas.

## Opportunity Canvases
- **Marketplace Codas:** Auto-assemble product drops, pricing tests, and customer scripts for Etsy/Shopify while keeping copy decks local.
- **UGC Pipelines:** Spin up performer briefs and stage-by-stage production schedules that pay within 24 hours.
- **Annotation & Testing Cells:** Deploy self-owned labeling rigs mirroring RWS-style tasks with your own QA and invoicing.

## Loop-Hole & Arbitrage Toolkit
- Mirror competitor drops via public telemetry, but remix through embodied tempo for differentiation.
- Capture abandoned APIs/feeds (e.g., marketplace search trends) into the sovereign spine for faster ideation.
- Offer white-label spell loops to clients aiming at $250k annual digital revenue, retaining IP via encrypted archives.

## Human-in-the-Loop Safeguards
- Every automation requires conductor approval; attention becomes both input (intention) and output (feedback).
- Simulation kernel flags vendor lock-in risk scores before launching any third-party integration.
- Spell loops expire unless reviewed, keeping the craft adaptive and alive.

## Mythic Glossary
- **Spell Loop:** A packaged ritual for generating, launching, and maintaining digital offerings.
- **Mirror Syntax:** Projection language born from choreography—movement becomes markup.
- **Temporal Baton:** Wearable-feedback wand guiding when to advance, pause, or pivot.

## Next Experiments
1. Prototype the wearable using open-hardware IMUs plus a portable ultrasound heartbeat sensor.
2. Build a local knowledge-graph service (SQLite + `sqlite-vec`) to store spell loops and revenue telemetry.
3. Encode Balanchine-Stravinsky codas as timing templates; map them to marketplace launch cadences.
4. Implement a projection renderer using Three.js for volumetric ritual mirroring in the console.
