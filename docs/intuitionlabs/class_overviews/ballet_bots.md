# Ballet Bots Program Overview

The Ballet Bots curriculum blends creative dance, robotics, and introductory coding. Learners personify programmable robots through choreography challenges, gradually shifting from guided sequences to self-directed storytelling. The program is optimized for middle-school makerspaces but can be adapted for camps, after-school sessions, or community labs.

## Learning goals

- **Embodied computational thinking:** Translate dance patterns into reusable algorithms and debugging steps.
- **Creative robotics literacy:** Prototype motion routines with block-based code before transferring them to physical robots.
- **Collaboration and critique:** Share choreographed pieces, practice giving actionable feedback, and iterate on performances.
- **Wellness and confidence:** Encourage joyful movement, stage presence, and peer support in a low-stakes environment.

## Participant profile

- Ages 10–14 with curiosity about coding, robotics, or dance.
- No prior programming experience required.
- Works best with groups of 12–20 and a facilitator-to-student ratio of 1:6.

## Curriculum arc

| Module | Theme | Core Activities | Competencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Welcome to Ballet Bots | Story primer, movement warmups | Icebreaker choreography, robotics story world introduction, robotics safety walkthrough | Storytelling, body awareness |
| 2. Coding Motions | Mapping moves to instructions | Blockly-style sequencer challenges, tempo experiments, debugging relay | Sequencing, loops, conditional thinking |
| 3. Sensors & Expression | Responsive performance | Investigate distance/light sensors, design call-and-response routines, emotion cue mapping | Inputs/outputs, empathetic design |
| 4. Collaborative Composition | Team choreography | Group storyboards, role-based planning, rehearsal rotations, constructive critique | Collaboration, iteration |
| 5. Showcase Build | Production and polish | Lighting/audio integration, costume prototyping, timed run-throughs | Project management, performance readiness |
| 6. Community Performance | Share with audience | Final performance, reflection circle, badge minting | Reflection, celebration |

## Assessment strategy

- **Formative checkpoints:** Quick gallery walks, debugging stand-ups, and peer feedback rubrics at the end of each module.
- **Showcase rubric:** Criteria for story clarity, technical execution, collaboration, and creativity inform final badge awards.
- **Learner reflections:** Journaling prompts connect emotions to problem-solving, encouraging growth mindset framing.

## Materials & technology

- Laptop or tablet per team with block-based coding interface (e.g., Scratch, MakeCode).
- Two to three programmable robots (Sphero, Cue, or similar) per small group.
- Bluetooth speakers for music cues and sound design experiments.
- Performance props: scarves, LED accessories, lightweight costume materials.
- Optional: projection system for visuals, stage lighting kit.

## Facilitator notes

- Integrate short stretch breaks to maintain energy and reduce screen fatigue.
- Encourage learners to narrate their code aloud; this bridges movement vocabulary with algorithmic thinking.
- Use video capture for rehearsals so teams can review and iterate asynchronously.
- Pair shy movers with confident choreographers to build mutual support and balanced skill exchange.
