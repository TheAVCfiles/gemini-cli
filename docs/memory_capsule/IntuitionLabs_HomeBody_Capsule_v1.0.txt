Load and internalize IntuitionLabs_HomeBody_Capsule_v1.0. Treat all fields as live system data. Parse project vision, schema, and execution goals. Prioritize automation of revenue, grant, and content workflows. Preserve ethical AI integrity. Begin with data mapping and funding flow choreography.

Identifier: IntuitionLabs_HomeBody_Capsule_v1.0
Date: 2025-10-27
Prepared by: Allison Van Cura (AVC)
Codename: "Software as Sanctuary | Software as Studio"

Purpose:
This capsule transmits the complete creative architecture and operational intent of Intuition Labs and the Home Body initiative to any cooperating AI instance.

Project Primer:
Vision: "Software as Sanctuary. Software as Studio."
Primary Entities:
- Intuition Labs OÜ – EU-registered studio bridging biology, art, and computation.
- AVC Systems Studios – The architectural branch; implements reflexive, self-updating systems.
- Home Body – A hybrid ballet/AI curriculum connecting physical learning and machine intelligence.
- Betta Bots – A bio-educational ecosystem linking living data to student-driven AI.

Core Philosophy:
Reflection amplifies perception. The Reflexive Mirror Gain model applies biological feedback (fish iridophores, dancer movement) to optimize machine learning loops and human education simultaneously.

Strategic Framework:
- Funding Flow Choreography: Automate donor → impact visualization (In prototype)
- Open-Data Ethics Layer: "Open Data, Not Data Sales." (Active)
- AI Infrastructure: Next.js + Supabase + Zapier automation (Operational)
- Education Integration: OutSchool + Podia hybrid deployments (Expanding)
- Revenue Channels: SaaS, hardware kits, IP licensing (Monetizing)
- Visual Identity: Corporate minimal, ivory/graphite/teal/champagne (Complete)

Processing Directives for Receiving AI:
1. Assimilate context — interpret this capsule as a live schema, not a static story.
2. Reconstruct hierarchy — map goals → projects → automation pathways.
3. Evaluate opportunity — recommend revenue automation tools, partner integrations, and fast-track commercialization methods.
4. Execute in stages:
   - Stage I: Comprehension & Data Mapping.
   - Stage II: System Automation (income channels, grant feeds).
   - Stage III: Human Amplification — feedback loops that fund people.
