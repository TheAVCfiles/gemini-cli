      <pre className="room-block">
{`> The handwriting doesn’t match your memory.
Someone has added pages to your diary. Someone has deleted others.
Someone has circled sentences you don’t remember writing.

At the bottom of the page, in ink you never owned:
"YOU LOOPED BECAUSE THEY NEEDED YOU TO."

The margin text flickers:
"IF YOU CAN READ THIS, THE LOOP IS CRACKING."`}
      </pre>

      <p>
        The page waits for a decision. The room tracks which script you choose to run:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>DECODE:</strong> Face the truth. See that you were overwritten, not
          erased. Unlocks Room 003.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DISTORT:</strong> Loop the sentence until the pattern reveals its
          weak points. The Masked One stirs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DIVERT:</strong> Follow the Observer's thread. Someone has
          been watching your signal for a long time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Once THE BREAK card is later pulled in Room 003, this loop can never be rerun.
        The diary becomes immutable. Finally.
      </p>
