# Ballet Bots Program Overview

The Ballet Bots curriculum blends creative dance, robotics, and introductory coding. Learners personify programmable robots through choreography challenges, gradually shifting from guided sequences to self-directed storytelling. The program is optimized for middle-school makerspaces but can be adapted for camps, after-school sessions, or community labs. Its narrative spine follows the Balanchine Cipher theory and the Decrypt the Girl engine created by Allison Van Cura, which map movement motifs to computational thinking milestones.

## Learning goals

- **Embodied computational thinking:** Translate dance patterns into reusable algorithms and debugging steps.
- **Creative robotics literacy:** Prototype motion routines with block-based code before transferring them to physical robots.
- **Collaboration and critique:** Share choreographed pieces, practice giving actionable feedback, and iterate on performances.
- **Wellness and confidence:** Encourage joyful movement, stage presence, and peer support in a low-stakes environment.

## Participant profile

- Ages 10–14 with curiosity about coding, robotics, or dance.
- No prior programming experience required.
- Works best with groups of 12–20 and a facilitator-to-student ratio of 1:6.

## Curriculum arc

| Module | Theme | Core Activities | Competencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Welcome to Ballet Bots | Story primer, movement warmups | Icebreaker choreography, robotics story world introduction, robotics safety walkthrough | Storytelling, body awareness rooted in Balanchine Cipher theory motif decoding |
| 2. Coding Motions | Mapping moves to instructions | Blockly-style sequencer challenges, tempo experiments, debugging relay | Sequencing, loops, conditional thinking |
| 3. Sensors & Expression | Responsive performance | Investigate distance/light sensors, design call-and-response routines, emotion cue mapping | Inputs/outputs, empathetic design informed by Decrypt the Girl engine responsiveness models |
| 4. Collaborative Composition | Team choreography | Group storyboards, role-based planning, rehearsal rotations, constructive critique | Collaboration, iteration |
| 5. Showcase Build | Production and polish | Lighting/audio integration, costume prototyping, timed run-throughs | Project management, performance readiness |
| 6. Community Performance | Share with audience | Final performance, reflection circle, badge minting | Reflection, celebration |

Throughout the arc, the Balanchine Cipher theory scaffolds how learners translate ballet-inspired motifs into programmable phrases, while the Decrypt the Girl engine models responsive storytelling beats that culminate in the showcase badges Allison Van Cura envisioned.

## Assessment strategy

- **Formative checkpoints:** Quick gallery walks, debugging stand-ups, and peer feedback rubrics at the end of each module.
- **Showcase rubric:** Criteria for story clarity, technical execution, collaboration, and creativity inform final badge awards.
- **Learner reflections:** Journaling prompts connect emotions to problem-solving, encouraging growth mindset framing.

## Materials & technology

- Laptop or tablet per team with block-based coding interface (e.g., Scratch, MakeCode).
- Two to three programmable robots (Sphero, Cue, or similar) per small group.
- Bluetooth speakers for music cues and sound design experiments.
- Performance props: scarves, LED accessories, lightweight costume materials.
- Optional: projection system for visuals, stage lighting kit.

## Facilitator notes

- Integrate short stretch breaks to maintain energy and reduce screen fatigue.
- Encourage learners to narrate their code aloud; this bridges movement vocabulary with algorithmic thinking.
- Use video capture for rehearsals so teams can review and iterate asynchronously.
- Pair shy movers with confident choreographers to build mutual support and balanced skill exchange.
