# Ballet Bots Lesson Plans

Each session is designed for 90 minutes but can be condensed to 60 minutes by trimming optional extensions. The plans assume access to a makerspace with open floor area and two facilitators.[^ip-credit]

## Session 1 – Storyworld Launch

- **Focus:** Introduce Ballet Bots narrative and establish group norms.
- **Agenda:**
  1. `0:00–0:10` Arrival soundtrack & freeform movement warmup.
  2. `0:10–0:25` Program overview, safety briefing, and community agreements.
  3. `0:25–0:40` Robotics storyworld slideshow with facilitator-led demo.
  4. `0:40–1:05` Team challenge: improvise “robot greetings” in trios, capture on tablets.
  5. `1:05–1:20` Reflection circle; students record one goal in notebooks.
- **Prep checklist:** Charge robots, stage lighting cues, print goal tracker sheets.

## Session 2 – Coding Motions Lab

- **Focus:** Translate choreography into block-based code.
- **Agenda:**
  1. `0:00–0:15` Rhythm mirroring warmup with tempo changes.
  2. `0:15–0:35` Facilitator demo of loop blocks and timing controls.
  3. `0:35–1:00` Stations: debugging relay, code remix challenge, tempo tester.
  4. `1:00–1:20` Gallery walk and peer feedback using “Glow/Grow” sticky notes.
- **Prep checklist:** Load starter projects, set up floor markers, print debugging rubrics.

## Session 3 – Sensor Storytelling

- **Focus:** Use sensors to trigger expressive movement.
- **Agenda:**
  1. `0:00–0:10` Breath and balance warmup with sensor props.
  2. `0:10–0:30` Mini-lesson on inputs/outputs; quick unplugged simulation.
  3. `0:30–1:05` Teams design responsive routines, test with audio cues.
  4. `1:05–1:20` Reflection journaling and evidence upload for minting queue.
- **Prep checklist:** Calibrate sensors, prepare optional audio loops, set up low-light corner.

## Session 4 – Collaborative Composition

- **Focus:** Co-create multi-part routines with narrative clarity.
- **Agenda:**
  1. `0:00–0:10` Trust-building warmup (mirrored walking with eyes closed).
  2. `0:10–0:30` Introduce storyboard template and project roles (director, coder, movement lead).
  3. `0:30–1:05` Teams iterate on storyboards, film rough cut, exchange critiques.
  4. `1:05–1:20` Capture action items in shared doc; update badge progress tracker.
- **Prep checklist:** Print storyboard templates, prepare critique sentence stems, ensure camera devices charged.

## Session 5 – Showcase Build Sprint

- **Focus:** Add production polish and technical reliability.
- **Agenda:**
  1. `0:00–0:15` Energy check-in and stage layout review.
  2. `0:15–0:35` Rapid prototyping: lighting cues, costume experiments, audio mixing.
  3. `0:35–1:10` Full run-throughs with timing notes, refine transitions.
  4. `1:10–1:20` Stage management assignments and final checklist.
- **Prep checklist:** Reserve performance space, gather costume bins, stage manager clipboard.

## Session 6 – Community Showcase

- **Focus:** Celebrate progress and capture evidence for minting.
- **Agenda:**
  1. `0:00–0:15` Sound check and backstage mindfulness exercise.
  2. `0:15–0:55` Performance with family/community audience.
  3. `0:55–1:10` Audience feedback wall and photo booth.
  4. `1:10–1:20` Badge reveal ceremony and gratitude circle.
- **Prep checklist:** Send reminders to families, set up livestream/recording, prepare badge QR cards.

## Differentiation strategies

- Offer tactile coding cards for learners who benefit from physical manipulatives.
- Provide advanced debugging challenges for experienced coders (nested loops, dual-robot synchronization).
- Pair English language learners with bilingual peers and offer vocabulary cards with visuals.

## Facilitator reflection prompts

- Which activity generated the most joyful engagement today?
- Where did learners struggle, and how can tomorrow’s warmup scaffold that skill?
- What badge evidence still needs to be captured before the next session?
