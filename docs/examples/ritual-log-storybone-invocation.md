# Storybone Invocation Ritual Log Template

This template captures the Slack ritual post for Storybone invocations. Use it when
logging entries to `#ritual-log`.

```
App: Slack
Channel: #ritual-log
Message:
ðŸª¶ Storybone Invocation
"The pen is mightier than the sword in that stone.
She wrote the story into the bone."
User: {{Full Name}} | Sun: {{sun_sign}}
Timestamp: {{zap_meta_human_now}}
```

## Usage Notes

- Replace `{{Full Name}}` with the participant's full name (e.g., `Avery Quinn`).
- Provide the participant's sun sign in place of `{{sun_sign}}` (e.g., `Leo`).
- Populate `{{zap_meta_human_now}}` with the ISO 8601 timestamp generated by the
  ritual automation.
- Preserve the line break inside the quotation so the couplet renders correctly in
  Slack.
- The feather emoji sets the tone for the invocation and should not be changed.

## Context

Storybone invocations bind narrative intent to the cohort ledger. Recording the
post in this structured format ensures downstream automations can parse the
metadata block reliably.
