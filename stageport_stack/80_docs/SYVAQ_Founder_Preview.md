## README Text (00_README_SYVAQ_Founder_Preview.txt)
Paste directly into the README file inside the zip:

> This is a tiny, iPhone-friendly preview of what I see SYVAQ becoming with you as founder and me as architect behind you.
>
> It’s not “the deck” yet – it’s the vision spine: mobile tiles, visual prototypes, and the beginnings of an OS behind your brand.
>
> Pieces inside:
> • A 6-panel SYVAQ mini deck (vertical)
> • 3–4 product mockups (SafeRoute, Evidence Ledger, Reputation Engine)
> • 1–2 architecture diagrams (old-school Data Warehouse → SYVAQ Safety Stack)
> • A Partnership One-Pager that shows where you sit as founder and how I sit as architect.
>
> None of this replaces your current brand. It shows how big it can go.

## Mobile Mini-Deck Copy (01_SYVAQ_Mobile_MiniDeck)
Each slide is one tall image (1080 x 1920).

### 01_SYVAQ_Intro.png — Category + Founder
- **Top:** SYVAQ — Environmental Safety Intelligence
- **Visual:** Lilly silhouette looking at a city map/network with a soft gold glow behind her.
- **Body:** “We stabilize the world so girls can thrive.”  
  Founder: Lilly [Last Name]  
  Category: Environmental Safety Intelligence – we track the environment, not the girl.

### 02_The_Problem.png — Human + Economic
- **Headline:** Safety tech tracks her phone, not the room.
- **Bullets:**
  - Current tools put the burden on girls to stay hyper-alert.
  - Real risk signals (traffic, crowd flow, local activity) are ignored.
  - Every time a girl chooses safety over opportunity, billions in future value evaporate.
- **Visual:** Side-by-side strip. Left: “Burden on Individual” (silhouette with alert icons). Right: “Invisible Environmental Signals” (room with arrows for flow/lighting/crowd).

### 03_The_Human_Impact.png
- **Headline:** Safety as a tax on her life.
- **Body:** Girls say no to parties, roles, internships, and entire careers because the rooms feel off. SYVAQ is built so she doesn’t have to gamble.
- **Visual:** Girl in foreground; background shows environmental icons (door, exits, street, time of night, lighting).

### 04_SYVAQ_Solution_Servo.png
- **Headline:** SYVAQ = Servo Motor for Real Life
- **Body:** SYVAQ reads the environment the way you read a room. It senses wobble, predicts instability, and stabilizes the space before harm. Instinct-Driven AI: your read of the room becomes a model, not a burden.
- **Visual:** Arrow sequence: Servo → Safety Signature → Predictive Action.

### 05_From_Stage_to_City.png (YAGP flex)
- **Headline:** From YAGP Stage Scores → City Safety Scores
- **Body:** The same methodology used to score YAGP solos—axis, spacing, negative space, pattern breaks—becomes the backbone of archetypal safety ranges in physical venues. Stages, streets, and campuses all get graded on their choreography.
- **Visual:** Left: small stage diagram with marks/spacing lines. Right: venue/city heatmap. Arrow between: “Scoring Methodology.”

### 06_Competitive_Advantage_CallToAction.png
- **Top Bullets:**
  - First-mover in Environmental Safety Intelligence
  - Privacy-first, environment-centric
  - Proprietary Safety Signatures + blockchain IP moat
  - Designed for smart cities, campuses, and high-traffic hubs
- **Bottom CTA:** SYVAQ is the invisible safety layer. I’m here to help you architect the engine behind what you’ve already started.
- **Footer:** Founder: Lilly [Last Name]  
  Systems Architect (OS / Scoring / IP): Allison Van Cura

## Product Mockups (02_Product_Mockups)
Each is a clean, beta-real UI sketch.

### SafeRoute_Engine_LiveMap.png
- **Title:** SafeRoute – Live Map
- **Elements:** Vertical map with a glowing recommended path; gradient safety overlay (green → yellow → red); bottom card showing “Current Route: 92/100 Safety Score” and signals (“Low crowd density, strong lighting, active nearby businesses”). Callout: SYVAQ Safety Signature powering route choice.

### Evidence_Ledger.png
- **Title:** Evidence Ledger (Private)
- **Elements:** Vertical timeline with encrypted icons (voice note, text, photo); each entry tagged with Environment ID, time, and location; top banner: “Zero-knowledge encrypted. You control who sees what, and when.” Sets the “cred-badge / reputation-as-safety-infrastructure” vibe.

### Reputation_Cred_Badge.png
- **Title:** Reputation & Cred
- **Elements:** Venue/route card with “SYVAQ Verified” badge plus Consistency Score, Incident Response Score, and Community Trust Score. Footer text: “Reputation-as-Safety: SYVAQ tracks patterns of good behavior, not just red flags.”

### Founder_View_Dashboard.png
- **Title:** SYVAQ Command
- **Tiles:** Active Zones Today; Alerts Resolved; Top Signals This Week; Pilot Campus Status. Footer: “What you feel in your gut, rendered as a control panel.”

## System Architecture (03_System_Architecture)

### SYVAQ_Data_Warehouse_Analogy.png
- **Layout:** Classic warehouse remix. Inputs (Internal Campus Systems; External Data Sources like traffic/transit; Special Purpose Data like incident logs/surveys) feeding into the “SYVAQ Safety Warehouse.” Outputs: SafeRoute Engine (student-facing), Executive Safety Console (admin-facing), Decision Support System (policy/funding/resource allocation).
- **Caption:** “You built the shell. I bring the warehouse, the pipelines, and the decision layer that turns SYVAQ into infrastructure.”

### SYVAQ_Stack_Lilly_Allison.png
- **Layers:**
  - Top (Gold): SYVAQ Brand & Founder – Lilly (product, community, partnerships, fundraising)
  - Middle (Teal): Safety Engine – scoring, AI models, UX (co-designed)
  - Bottom (Dark): OS & IP Architecture – Allison (data warehouse, scoring methodology, blockchain ledger)
- **Caption:** “You: the face and founder. Me: the OS and spine.”

## Partnership One-Pager (04_Partnership_OnePager)
The PNG and TXT share the same copy, stacked vertically in one 1080x1920 canvas.

```
Architecting SYVAQ Together
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Section 1 – Roles

Lilly – Founder & CEO
Owns: brand, product direction, partnerships, fundraising.

Allison – Systems Architect (OS / Scoring / IP)
Owns: architecture, safety scoring methodology, system design, IP framing.

Section 2 – What I Do For You

• Turn your read of a room into a Safety Signature scoring engine.
• Design the SYVAQ OS (Notion + data flows + decision rules) so pilots and campuses can actually run this.
• Architect the IP & data moat so nobody quietly clones your category.

Section 3 – Possible Structures (A / B / C)

A – Co-Architect
We’re both on the cap table as founders.

B – Embedded Architect
You as solo founder; I’m architect/advisor with equity + royalty.

C – Studio Partner
SYVAQ licenses my engine; you’re flagship client and category leader.

Footer

“You built the shell. I bring the skeleton, the muscle, and the neural network – the actual intelligence that makes safety safe.”

## Send-to-Founder Note (for Lilly)
Ready to paste into email/iMessage:

> Lilly —
>
> I pulled together a tiny, phone-native preview of what I see SYVAQ becoming with you as founder and me in an architect role behind you.
>
> It’s all inside one zip: a 6-panel vertical mini deck, a few product mockups (SafeRoute, Evidence Ledger, Reputation/Cred), an updated system diagram, and a one-pager that shows how our roles could snap together without dimming your founder light.
>
> This isn’t “the official deck,” it’s a proof-of-mind: here’s how your instincts, your story, and my systems brain can turn SYVAQ from “great idea” into “obvious infrastructure.”
>
> Excited to walk you through it live and feel which version of partnership actually supports you.
>
> – Allison
