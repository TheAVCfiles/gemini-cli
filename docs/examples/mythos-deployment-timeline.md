- **Signal Ignition:** Initiate public communications and bring the DeCrypt Engine online.
- **Mythos Deployment:** Synchronize the Surface, Cipher, and Echo layers to reveal the experience.
- **Expansion Pulse:** Share the experience broadly through decks, newsletters, and community broadcasts.
- **Structural Anchor:** Finalize funding and on-chain commitments to solidify the initiative.
- **Return Loop:** Revisit the systems in 2026 to translate the mythic blueprint into ongoing practice.
