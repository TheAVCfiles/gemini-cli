# B2A / D2C Go-to-Market Strategy

## Purpose
This guide articulates a dual-motion go-to-market plan that combines a **Business-to-Advocates (B2A)** channel program with a **Direct-to-Consumer (D2C)** motion. The B2A track builds leverage through partners, community leaders, and domain specialists who can vouch for the product. The D2C track ensures rapid, measurable adoption by end users through self-serve experiences and retail-style campaigns. Both motions share a unified brand narrative and product proof points to avoid fragmented positioning.

## Objectives and success measures
- **Adoption velocity:** 30% month-over-month growth in activated accounts in the first 90 days across both motions.
- **Revenue mix:** 60% D2C revenue, 40% B2A-influenced revenue by the end of H1 to reduce channel dependency risk.
- **Advocate depth:** 100 certified advocates with at least one published case study, workshop, or tutorial each by the end of the first two quarters.
- **Retention:** 20% uplift in 90-day retention for users who enter through B2A-led channels versus pure D2C.
- **Efficiency:** Blended CAC/LTV ratio below 0.25 after six months; channel CAC should remain below 70% of D2C CAC.

## Audience segmentation
- **Advocates / partners (B2A):** Agencies, expert creators, community moderators, solution integrators, and educators who can distribute or implement the product. They need proof of revenue, enablement kits, and roadmap trust.
- **Consumers (D2C):** Individual users who trial and buy directly. They need instant value, transparent pricing, clear onboarding, and social proof.
- **Bridge personas:** Power users who can graduate into advocates. They begin as D2C users but are invited into the B2A program after demonstrating mastery or reach.

## Positioning and product narratives
- **Core promise:** "Precision-first creation: fast builds with verifiable outcomes and community-grade safeguards." This applies to both motions.
- **For advocates:** Emphasize revenue opportunities (referrals, services, resale), shared roadmap influence, and templated deployment kits.
- **For consumers:** Emphasize speed-to-value, delightful onboarding, and guardrails that keep projects safe and reversible.
- **Proof assets:** Short demos with transparent success metrics, benchmarks against common workflows, and reversible trials (one-click rollback) to lower perceived risk.

## Packaging and pricing
- **D2C offers:**
  - Free tier with rate-limited access and watermarking for quick trials.
  - Growth tier with usage-based billing and unlockable credits for referrals.
  - Premium tier with priority support and advanced automation connectors.
- **B2A offers:**
  - Advocate starter: co-branded landing page, sandbox credits, and a 10% referral share.
  - Pro advocate: deployment stipends, joint marketing funds, and solution blueprints; tiered rebates tied to qualified deals and NRR.
  - Enterprise alliance: annual commits, SLAs, and roadmap co-planning. Includes training seats and certification renewals.
- **Pricing hygiene:** Keep three public SKUs; expand via add-ons instead of custom bundles. Publish a rebate and referral calculator to maintain transparency.

## B2A motion
- **Recruitment:**
  - Target communities where the product already has organic mentions; run "teach-and-earn" webinars and certify the first 50 advocates quickly.
  - Offer lightweight application flow with proof-of-experience questions to filter for quality.
- **Enablement:**
  - Provide a demo-in-a-box kit: pitch deck, pricing one-pager, ROI calculator, and sandbox with pre-seeded sample projects.
  - Create a solutions gallery advocates can fork, with annotated checklists and rollback instructions.
- **Incentives:**
  - Multi-stage rewards: registration bonus, activation bonus (first live deployment), retention bonus (90-day usage), and NPS-linked accelerator.
  - Quarterly co-marketing calendar with funded events, AMAs, and guest posts.
- **Governance:**
  - Require pipeline visibility (deal registration) and publish acceptance SLAs.
  - Quarterly business reviews to refresh quotas, training, and product roadmap alignment.

## D2C motion
- **Acquisition channels:**
  - SEO/SEM built around job-to-be-done queries and comparison keywords.
  - App marketplaces and template directories with free trials that capture intent-rich users.
  - Influencer and creator partnerships with trackable referral codes that also feed B2A recruitment.
- **Activation:**
  - Two-click onboarding with pre-built templates, sample data, and a visible progress bar.
  - In-product guardrails: sandbox mode by default, reversible actions, and milestone-based tips.
  - Lifecycle messaging: day 0 quickstart, day 3 value unlock tutorial, day 7 "ship your first project" challenge.
- **Conversion:**
  - Time-bound upgrade offers tied to usage milestones rather than arbitrary discounts.
  - Social proof inside the product (template popularity, verified advocate endorsements) to reduce friction.
- **Retention:**
  - Weekly digest of outcomes (saves, time won, benchmarks) and recommendations.
  - Community-led office hours that double as advocate discovery for the B2A pipeline.

## Shared operating model
- **Systems:** unified CRM with channel attribution, self-serve billing, and consent-aware marketing automation. Maintain one audience map so advocates and consumers share lifecycle states.
- **Content factory:** editorial calendar that pairs every feature with a tutorial, short demo, and advocate spotlight. Publish both on web and inside the product.
- **Data:** shared metrics definitions across motions (activation, expansion, churn) with dashboards that break out D2C vs. B2A-influenced performance.
- **Experimentation:** monthly growth sprints with paired tests in both motions (e.g., onboarding variant for D2C, enablement variant for B2A).
- **Trust & safety:** standardized review for claims, templated consent flows, and opt-in data sharing. Advocate agreements include usage standards and escalation paths.

## Launch and expansion timeline
1. **Pre-launch (Weeks 1–3):** finalize pricing pages, referral calculator, and demo-in-a-box. Recruit pilot advocates and publish three flagship tutorials.
2. **Launch (Weeks 4–6):** run a D2C-focused live demo series, push comparison landing pages, and announce advocate program with a public leaderboard.
3. **Stabilize (Weeks 7–10):** ship activation improvements, collect NPS and case studies, and begin quarterly business reviews with top advocates.
4. **Scale (Weeks 11–16):** expand into two new verticals with localized playbooks; run joint webinars and marketplace promotions; publish win-loss insights.

## Risk management
- **Channel conflict:** transparent lead registration and rebate rules; publish conflict resolution times.
- **Quality drift:** regular audits of advocate-led implementations; revoke badges if standards slip.
- **CAC inflation:** cap paid acquisition at a fixed CAC/LTV guardrail and shift budget to co-marketing if thresholds are exceeded.
- **Retention gaps:** trigger advocate interventions when D2C cohorts show early drop-off; pair them with refreshed onboarding content.

## Measurement and governance
- **Weekly:** activation funnel performance, CAC/LTV by motion, support volume by segment.
- **Monthly:** pipeline sourced vs. influenced, retention curves by entry point, advocate activity (events, content, deals).
- **Quarterly:** roadmap alignment, rebate recalibration, NRR progress, and vertical expansion scorecard.
- **Decision cadence:** go/no-go on channel investments based on efficiency metrics and customer proof depth, not vanity traffic.
