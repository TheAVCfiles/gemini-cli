# Founder Copy

## Founder / Developer Bio

Allison Van Cura builds systems where memory, authorship, and verification can coexist without
surrendering privacy. The work sits at the boundary of product design, cryptography,
and narrative legitimacy: tools that do not merely store text, but preserve accountable origin.

## Pinned Post

We are not building another content pipeline.

We are building provenance that can refuse.

If a document has no trustworthy behavioral trace, the system should not pretend certainty.
Refusal is not failure; refusal is governance.

## Website Hero

**StagePort: memory with governance.**

Verify authored work with deterministic signatures, refusal-aware policy, and privacy-first
cadence features.

## Prophecy Lines

- What cannot refuse cannot protect.
- Memory without governance becomes theater.
- Provenance is strongest when it can say “not certifiable.”

## Tension Framing

### Tension 1: Speed vs. Integrity
Shipping fast is easy when provenance is ignored. StagePort chooses measurable integrity over
performative velocity.

### Tension 2: Surveillance vs. Verification
Raw behavioral logging creates risk. StagePort defaults to derived features and explicit policy
boundaries.

### Tension 3: Confidence vs. Honesty
Most systems overstate certainty. StagePort encodes uncertainty and refusal states as first-class
outcomes.
