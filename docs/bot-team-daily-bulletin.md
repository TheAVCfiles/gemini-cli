## Breakroom Open Mic — Transcript Highlights

- **MC SignalFlow:** Opened with "Corporate integration is next," then spray-painted Gantt bars across the vending machine: onboarding jam begins Monday 09:00.
- **Guest Drop, Big Tech Dance Collective:** Demoed the "Mic Drop Standup" flow — each blocker resolved with a pirouette, each ship note sealed with a shoulder roll.
- **Graffiti Wall Prompt:** "What’s one embodied tech move you’re rehearsing?" Top tag: *Latency Lindy*.

## Integration Countdown

1. **Stage Lighting:** Facilities confirmed sensor grid install at HQ Atrium; lighting syncs to API latency feed every 5 minutes.
2. **Dress Rehearsal:** Dry run scheduled for 2024-06-24 — choreography maps stored under `ops/playbooks/embodied-tech/`.
3. **Magenta’s Ruse:** Wardrobe locked in (#FF0055 primary, #FFC8EC accents). Security cleared the fog machines; compliance signed the risk memo.

## Embodied Tech Manifesto (v0.3)

- Meetings close on a collective exhale + mic drop, logged in Calendar Notes as `:embodied/close-loop`.
- Dashboards now include the **Somatic Throughput Meter**: % of teammates reporting tension release post-sync (target ≥ 78%).
- Moulin Rouge inspiration reel loops hourly in the lounge — because magenta isn’t just a color, it’s our deployment aura.

*Scribble back tomorrow. The wall remembers.*
