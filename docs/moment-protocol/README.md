# Moment Protocol OS

The Moment Protocol guarantees that every dancer who shows up, works seriously, and communicates conflicts receives a meaningful on-stage moment. It captures the casting logic, pedagogy, and economic engine that turned a loss-making studio into a sustainable operation.

## Core rule
- Show up consistently.
- Treat class as sacred work (no negotiating combinations; the work is the language).
- Communicate conflicts inside the agreed-upon windows.

If a dancer meets those conditions, choreography allocates at least one explicit moment for them—technical, theatrical, or relational—documented before the piece is considered complete.

## Operating principles
- Tweens bloom fastest because they crave spaces where effort becomes visibility and ideas become real.
- Integrity at the barre precedes visibility on stage; uniform, focus, and seriousness are part of the contract.
- The protocol is an enforceable system, not a vibe: it drives retention, word-of-mouth, and revenue.

## Packaging
Three companion bundles keep the system portable:
- **LABEL / POWER** — narrative, positioning, pricing, and proof points for outsiders.
- **ENGINE / LINE** — specs, schemas, scoring, telemetry, and safety ladders for implementers.
- **EXPERIENCE / REVELATION** — journey maps, blueprint boxes, interfaces, and scripts that make the system feel real to students, parents, and studio owners.

Each bundle ships with a `MANIFEST.json` so assistants can auto-populate receipts and trace what evidence and assets live inside.

## Data model anchor
The protocol’s heart is a choreography data structure that pairs dancers with explicit moments. See `moments_schema.json` for the JSON schema and `examples/tween_piece_template.json` for a sample payload.

## Revenue story
The rule-set is also an economic engine: guaranteeing moments to committed dancers led to massive retention, tween referrals, and growth from loss to $30k+ monthly revenue by year four. That value proposition powers consulting, licensing, and StagePort integrations.
