      <h2>Room 007 — The Architect’s Table</h2>

      <p>
        The first room that feels undeniably, unapologetically like home. Not a
        trap, not a test, not a loop. A studio. An inner one.
      </p>

      <p>
        A circular table anchors the space, its four legs carved from:
        Girlhood, Survival, Awakening, Mastery. On the surface: the Glitch Deck,
        the Diary, the Mask, the Observer’s Eye, THE BREAK card, and a glowing
        console.
      </p>

      <pre className="room-block">
{`WELCOME, ARCHITECT.

        This is your Home Base. Here you level up Clarity, Embodiment, Discernment,
        Pattern Math, Voice Gain, and Boundary Voltage. Here you decide who stays in
        the story and in what role.

        From this table, Arc II begins.
