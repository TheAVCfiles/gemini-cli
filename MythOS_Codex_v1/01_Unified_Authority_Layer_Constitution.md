# Unified Authority Layer (UAL) – OS Constitution v1.0

## 1. Governing Principle

**Structure converts motion to proof.**  
Engines may process; **humans decide**. Survivorship is not raw material – it is sovereign input.

## 2. Roles

- **Operator (Founder / Director / Architect)**  
  Final authority over protocol changes, narrative framing, and data release. Name in this codex: **Allison Van Cura**.

- **Faculty / Expert Witnesses**  
  Can log observations, issue credentials, and trigger safety flags. They cannot alter the core narrative canon.

- **Students / Performers**  
  Own their kinetic trace and narrative dignity. Their data requires explicit opt-in and revocable consent.

- **Engines (AI / Physics / Scorers)**  
  Status: **Advisory Only.**  
  They can score, cluster, and recommend; they can never have final say on casting, discipline, or moral judgment.

## 3. Non-Negotiables

1. **Engines help, never decide.**
2. **Glitch = Data, not defect.** Collapses, freezes, and “mistakes” are high-value signal, not shame.
3. **Survivor First Rendering.** Any interface that touches real humans must render them as authors, not objects.
4. **Transparent Math.** Any score, risk flag, or credential must be traceable back to:
   - Input → Processing → Output
   - Versioned model + threshold.
5. **No Ghost Labor.** No one’s trauma, likeness, or movement can be used to train systems or sell product without a clear, revocable agreement and share of upside.

## 4. Decision Hierarchy

1. **Body Test (Somatic Safety)**
2. **Law Test (Compliance & Harm)**
3. **Ethical Test (Dignity & Autonomy)**
4. **Physics Test (Math & Traceability)**
5. **Aesthetic Test (Clarity, Couture, Care)**

If any of 1–3 fail, system output is discarded, not debated.

## 5. Amendment Protocol

- Proposals logged as `UAL-CHANGE-[YYYY]-[nn]`.
- Require:
  - Founder signature.
  - One external expert witness (law / ethics / pedagogy).
- All accepted changes recorded in Sovereign Ledger in an `UAL_EVENT` entry.

## 6. Canon Statement

This Constitution is the **Unified Authority Layer** for:

- MythOS
- StagePort / StudioOS
- StageCred / Sovereign Ledger
- DeCrypt the Girl

Any product, deck, agent, or experiment in this universe is subordinate to this layer.
