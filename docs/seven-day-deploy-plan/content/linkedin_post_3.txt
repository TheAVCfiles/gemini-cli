LinkedIn Post #3 · Mercy Gate

Day 6 and the Mercy Gate is open. This is the invitation to the small group who actually needs the Adaptive Ethics Secure Edition right now.

What they receive:
• Echo Edition one-pager that shows the 7-day outcomes
• CTA to book a readiness scan or drop into a Calendly slot
• Clear link back to the DOI so procurement sees the provenance trail

If you’ve been waiting for a structured way to move from publication to qualified deals in a single week, this is it. Signal me with "Mercy" or head to https://YOURDOMAIN.tld/echo/ to see how the gate works.
