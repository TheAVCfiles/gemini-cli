# Poorigami Holiday Launch Kit

"Poorigami" turns the shared experience of being financially stretched into a badge of creativity. This concept pack outlines three printable holiday cards and one foldable ornament that can be listed on Etsy or a mini Shopify site next month.

## Brand Pillars
- **Tone:** Smart, gently cynical, and warm enough to feel sincere. Every piece should balance the joke with a genuine message of care.
- **Visual Language:** Clean vector lines, limited color palettes with strategic metallic accents, and micro-folds that elevate the finish.
- **Production Guidance:** Each download includes cardstock recommendations (200–250 gsm), suggested printer settings, assembly tips, and styled photography to prove the end result looks intentional, not cheap.

## Printable Card 1 — "Utility Bill of Rights"
- **Front Tagline:** "Because nothing says I love you like keeping the lights on together."
- **Visual Concept:** A faux utility bill layout reformatted into a holiday motif. Headings are replaced with "Festive Charges" such as "Shared Wi-Fi Warmth" and "Mutual Streaming Therapy." Totals are summarized as "Affection: Paid in Full."
- **Interior Message:** "Budget approved for one cozy evening, unlimited reruns, and exactly three fancy hot chocolates."
- **Design Notes:** Use a ledger-style grid with teal and charcoal inks, adding a thin gold-foil-look highlight line. Include a perforation-style dotted line that folds into a pop-up tab reading "PAID WITH LOVE."

## Printable Card 2 — "Ode to the Last Clean Hoodie"
- **Front Tagline:** "Folded with love, not cash."
- **Visual Concept:** Illustration of a dramatically spotlighted hoodie on a wire hanger, with laurel leaves made from receipt paper strips. Snowfall rendered as floating laundry suds.
- **Interior Message:** "We’re rich in warmth, memes, and whatever’s left in the dryer filter."
- **Design Notes:** Stick to a deep navy background, blush accents, and a single metallic silver layer for luxe contrast. Add a mini pop-up laundry basket when the card opens.

## Printable Card 3 — "Inbox Zero-ish"
- **Front Tagline:** "In this economy? Still thoughtful."
- **Visual Concept:** Email client mock interface with unread notifications replaced by "holiday cheer" tasks. Each checkbox reads things like "Send memes," "Share leftovers," "Pay you back (emotionally)."
- **Interior Message:** "Consider this the one message I actually replied to on time."
- **Design Notes:** Use pastel UI colors with crisp iconography. Add a fold-out tab shaped like a paper airplane that reveals a hidden "PS: IOU brunch when the market rebounds." message.

## Papercraft Ornament — "Overdraft Angel"
- **Tagline:** "Guardian of NSF Fees Everywhere."
- **Concept:** A 3D hanging ornament shaped like an angel assembled from faux bank statements and receipts. The halo is a cut-out circular graph labeled "Holiday Budget vs. Reality." Wings are layered with QR-code-style line art that points to a downloadable "motivational" audio loop.
- **Assembly:** Two-sided print with alignment guides, scored fold lines, and numbered tabs. Includes instructions for threading metallic embroidery floss through a hidden anchor. Optional upgrade layer adds mirrored cardstock for the halo.
- **Packaging Copy:** "Display above your bank app for protection, or at least a laugh before you check your balance."

## Launch-Ready Assets Checklist
1. **Design Files:** Provide both CMYK PDF and PNG previews for each product.
2. **Instructions Sheet:** One-page PDF with cardstock specs, printer tips (suggest high-quality print setting, manual duplexing for double-sided), and assembly diagrams.
3. **Lifestyle Photography:** Stage each finished piece against budget-friendly props (e.g., thrifted mugs, fairy lights) to showcase the high-finish look.
4. **Listing Copy:** Highlight the humor, affordability, and thoughtfulness in 2–3 bullet points per product. Emphasize instant download convenience.
5. **Social Snippets:** Prepare captions such as "This year’s gift budget: printer ink and trauma" and quick folding timelapses for Reels/TikTok.
