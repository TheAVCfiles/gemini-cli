# Decrypt The Girl — Dev

**Modes:** Surface / Cipher / Echo  
**Key:** A5 unlocks B5b; Caesar(+3 on vowels) in margin glyphs; “repetition with deviation” marks true routes.

## Quickstart
```bash
npm i
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:5173 and press Unlock B5b to simulate a route change.

Codex wake phrase (inside the Codex side panel)

Paste:

Load mythos.config.json. Use gpt-5-codex with high reasoning. 
Adopt Surface/Cipher/Echo mental model. 
Index docs/Manuscript and web/**. 
Propose a PR to upgrade decoder.js: implement Caesar(+3 on vowels) helper and a keyboard router (1/2/3 → Surface/Cipher/Echo).

You now have a clean, professional activation scaffold: Codex sees your intent, your modes, and the exact files to touch—no flailing, just flow. Next natural move: ask Codex to implement the Caesar(+3 on vowels) helper and a minimal router in decoder.js, then request a diff before applying.
