# APop Allstars Curriculum Notion Table

This example captures the Notion database schema and a sample row for the
"Girl Development Plan" board used in the APop Allstars choreography and
emotional intelligence program. The companion JSON file can be imported into
prototyping tools or referenced when building seeds for the Gemini CLI's
Notion connector experiments.

- **Schema source:** Interweaves physical conditioning, creative data
  literacy, and emotional resilience goals for girls aged 6–12.
- **Sample row:** Demonstrates how to stage warm-ups, trio cipher challenges,
  and reflection journaling while tracking cultural literacy checkpoints.

## Files

- [`apop-allstars-curriculum.json`](./apop-allstars-curriculum.json) — full
  schema with column metadata and an example record.

Feel free to remix the schema to match other performing arts cohorts by
updating the multi-select options or swapping in different cultural literacy
modules.
