1. PURPOSE & SCOPE
------------------------------------------------------------
This document formalizes the "Beaucoup Recoup™" model for AVC Systems Studio,
Prima, StagePort, Ballet Bank, and associated initiatives.

Beaucoup Recoup™ is the financial doctrine that:

  • Treats all founding intellectual property (IP), systems engineering,
    curriculum, and narrative assets as Recoupable Capital.
  • Routes all revenue through a Founder-first Recoup Pool until the declared
    capital amount is fully repaid.
  • Only after recoupment transitions the business into a multi-party
    profit and impact-sharing model (40/20/20/20).

Target baseline Recoupable Capital: 1,400,000 USD.


------------------------------------------------------------
2. DEFINITIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Recoupable Capital (RC)
All pre-launch and active-cycle expenditures, including but not limited to:
  • System architecture and engines (StagePort OS, StageCred, PyRouette,
    Marley Sensor Floor R&D, Ballet Bank logic, Astro/decoder tools).
  • Narrative systems and publishing (Decrypt the Girl scroll, survivor
    documentation packets, curricular stories, OS documentation).
  • Curriculum, pedagogy, and studio programs (Ballet Bots, Barre Code,
    Prima class libraries, workshops, residencies).
  • Legal, design, branding, UX, research, datasets, and any other IP
    necessary to operate the ecosystem.

2.2 Recoup Pool (RCP)
The ledger account representing the unpaid balance of Recoupable Capital.

2.3 Net Operating Revenue (NOR)
All gross receipts from programs, licenses, sales, grants, or donor
contributions, minus direct transaction/processing fees and taxes.

2.4 Post-Recoup Distribution Model (PRDM)
The 40/20/20/20 allocation framework used once RCP has been fully repaid:
  • 40% → AVC Operating & Future IP
  • 20% → Prima Foundation / Nonprofit arm
  • 20% → Co-op Residual Pool (dancers, teachers, creators)
  • 20% → Ballet Bank Trusts (long-term wealth for participants)


------------------------------------------------------------
3. CORE CLAUSE LANGUAGE
------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 Founder Recoupable Capital Clause

All intellectual property, system architecture, curriculum assets, narrative
materials, technical prototypes, datasets, software engines, and program
development created by Allison Van Cura ("Founder") constitute Recoupable
Capital in the amount of 1,400,000 USD.

All Net Operating Revenue generated by any AVC Systems Studio, Prima,
StagePort, Decrypt the Girl, Ballet Bank, or associated brand or program
shall first be allocated toward repayment of Recoupable Capital until fully
recouped.

During the recoup period, no party—including co-op members, contractors,
instructors, collective participants, or foundation beneficiaries—shall
receive profit distributions, revenue shares, or residual allocations except
as permitted under pre-agreed service wages or contractual minimums.

Upon full recoupment of the Founder’s Recoupable Capital, revenue
distribution transitions to the 40/20/20/20 Post-Recoup Distribution Model.


------------------------------------------------------------
4. LEDGER LOGIC
------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Revenue Routing Order

For each revenue event (ticket, class, license, grant, subscription, deck
sale, credential mint):

  1. Capture Gross Amount (GROSS).
  2. Subtract pass-through fees and taxes → Net Operating Revenue (NOR).
  3. Route NOR to:

       if RCP > 0:
           RCP_payment = min(NOR, RCP)
           RCP -= RCP_payment
           Remaining = NOR - RCP_payment
       else:
           Remaining = NOR

  4. If Remaining > 0 and RCP == 0:
       apply Post-Recoup Distribution Model (PRDM).

4.2 PRDM Allocation (after recoup)

  • 40% → AVC_Operating
  • 20% → Prima_Foundation
  • 20% → CoOp_Residual_Pool
  • 20% → BalletBank_Trusts

4.3 Example Calculation

Starting RCP: 1,400,000
Event NOR:   10,000

Case A — Pre-Recoup:

  RCP_payment = 10,000
  New RCP     = 1,390,000
  Remaining   = 0
  Distributions: none (beyond wages/minimums).

Case B — Post-Recoup (RCP already 0):

  Remaining = 10,000

  AVC_Operating    = 4,000
  Prima_Foundation = 2,000
  CoOp_Pool        = 2,000
  BalletBank       = 2,000


------------------------------------------------------------
5. PRODUCT & REVENUE MAPPING
------------------------------------------------------------

5.1 Example Products
  • Glitch Deck (tarot/glyph engine)
  • Street Cred Credentials (Verifiable Credentials for dancers/students)
  • Decrypt the Girl interactive book + masterclasses
  • Intuition Labs studio OS and AI curriculum
  • Sojourner Network & Prima Foundation programs
  • StagePort StudioOS licensing and Marley Sensor Floor packages

5.2 Recoup Behavior
All products share the same underlying doctrine:
  • Pre-recoup: 100% of NOR flows to the Founder’s Recoup Pool.
  • Post-recoup: 40/20/20/20 distribution applies automatically.


------------------------------------------------------------
6. BALLET BANK & TRUST STRUCTURE
------------------------------------------------------------

6.1 Individual Trust Sub-ledgers
Each qualifying dancer or participant may have a trust sub-ledger, such as:

  • dancer_id
  • total_shares
  • trust_balance
  • contribution_events

Sources of Ballet Bank funding:
  • PRDM 20% allocation after recoup.
  • Parent/Donor contributions at shows or recitals ("roses to reserves").
  • Scholarship programs funded by Prima Foundation.

6.2 Participant Example

After recoupment, a recital earns 20,000 NOR:

  • BalletBank allocation: 20% → 4,000
  • This 4,000 is split across dancer trust sub-ledgers according to a
    rule (e.g., equal shares, performance weighting, seniority, etc.).

At graduation or designated milestones, a dancer’s trust balance may be
partially or fully released in accordance with Ballet Bank policy.


------------------------------------------------------------
7. CO-OP RESIDUAL POOL
------------------------------------------------------------

7.1 Purpose
The Co-op Residual Pool ensures that dancers, teachers, and creative
contributors participate in the upside of the system after recoupment.

Sources:
  • 20% PRDM allocation after recoupment.
  • Optional project-based bonuses specified per show, deck, or campaign.

7.2 Residual Allocation
Residuals may be calculated based on:
  • Contribution credits (choreography, performance, creative IP).
  • Time investment or role weighting (lead, ensemble, teaching hours).
  • Longitudinal participation (loyalty-based multipliers).


------------------------------------------------------------
8. GOVERNANCE & TRANSPARENCY
------------------------------------------------------------

8.1 Reporting
The ledger should produce clear dashboards such as:
  • Remaining Recoup Balance (RCP).
  • Lifetime Recouped to Date.
  • PRDM Allocations over time.
  • Ballet Bank trust growth.
  • Co-op Residual distributions.

8.2 Documents
This doctrine should be referenced in:
  • Studio bylaws / operating agreement.
  • Co-op membership agreements.
  • Foundation charter and board policies.
  • Licensing contracts for StagePort/Prima/Ballet Bank.

8.3 Amendments
Any change to the baseline Recoupable Capital or PRDM percentages requires:
  • Founder consent, and
  • Supermajority board/co-op approval (threshold to be defined).


------------------------------------------------------------
9. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (MVP)
------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 1 — Paper + Spreadsheet
  • Declare initial Recoupable Capital (1.4M USD).
  • Create a Recoup ledger tab and log all incoming NOR manually.
  • Apply recoup-first calculations and report monthly.

Phase 2 — Ledger Engine Integration
  • Implement RCP and PRDM logic into StageCred / StagePort OS.
  • Connect to payment processors (Stripe, etc.) for automated recording.
  • Provide a dashboard for recoup progress and post-recoup splits.

Phase 3 — Full Ballet Bank & Co-op Rollout
  • Stand up trust sub-ledgers and residual pools.
  • finalize policy for distribution rules (who gets what, when, how).
  • Launch public-facing explanations for families, donors, and investors.
