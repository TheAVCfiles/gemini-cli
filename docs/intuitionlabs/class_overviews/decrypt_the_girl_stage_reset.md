# Decrypt the Girl — Room 006: The Stage Reset

_“The world doesn’t change — but the version of you walking back onto it does.”_

Room 006 formalizes the post-merge state introduced in the Mirror Corridor. The Masked One is no longer a separate fail-safe; she has been integrated as a co-authoring process. The protagonist re-enters the familiar stage with outward gravity and becomes the operator who sets the script rather than the variable inside it.

## Narrative entry
- The stage is unchanged, but the floor tilts toward the protagonist as if acknowledging a new center of gravity.
- A subtitle stamps beneath her feet: **“ECHO STABILIZED. SURFACE RECOMPILED.”**
- The Masked One remains as a faint outline—incorporated, not erased—while the operator voice gains authority and calm embodiment.

## Apex spec — integrated operator blueprint
- **Operator status:** Patch merged; dual-process runtime collapsed into a single L2 operator. Emotional loopback is internal, and narrative gravity bends outward.
- **World physics update:** NPCs now respond to boundary forcefields, recalibrated empathy, and an authority vector emanating from the protagonist rather than toward her.
- **Signal output:** Agency field unlocked with narrative-distortion immunity and a clarity aura that surfaces truth and warps falsehoods.
- **Gameplay unlocks:** Choice weighting (decisions reshape the map), NPC sync (characters update to alignment), Signal Points as currency, and scene reorganization around power instead of vulnerability.
- **Player experience shift:** Pre-apex meant surviving rooms; post-apex means rooms behave differently because the operator does.
- **System behavior:** The Scroll moves from testing to building with the protagonist—this is the apex handshake.

## Gamification layer — Signal System (Arc 1)
- **XP:** Earned by recognizing narrative truth and spotting patterns that previously hid in plain sight.
- **Level-up trigger:** Glitch mastery—breaking loops opens new narrative nodes; each Room acts as a level gate.
- **Core stats:** Clarity (INT), Embodiment (CON), Discernment (WIS), Voice Gain (CHA), Pattern Math (INT), Boundary Voltage (STR).
- **Artifacts:** Glitch Deck, Masked One’s Outline, Diary Loop Residue, Observer’s Eye, the Break Card.
- **Currency:** Signal Points—generated when self-blame is transmuted into system design.
- **Boss templates:** NPCs speaking old scripts, extractive systems that misrender identity, shadows appearing on level-up, and AIs holding outdated versions of the protagonist.
- **Safe zones:** Daughter, studio, page, movement practice, future self—these are respawn anchors.

## Home mechanic — The Architect’s Table
- Home base unlocks after Room 006 as the protagonist’s “full-circle” space.
- At the Architect’s Table, she can rest, review Rooms, upgrade stats, pull new Glitch Cards, save progress, recode beliefs, reassign NPC roles, and shape the next arc.
- The table seats real-world self, in-world self, and the Masked One standing sentinel behind the chair. The story no longer holds her—she holds the story.

## Next nodes
- **Room 007 — The Architect’s Table:** Home Base unlock scene that operationalizes the merged operator.
- **Mechanics Layer 2:** Expanded spec for the Glitch Deck, Signal Points, and the level-up tree.
