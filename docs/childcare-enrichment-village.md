# Childcare + Enrichment Village Deliverables

This document consolidates strategic, fundraising, and operational collateral for the Childcare + Enrichment Village concept in Fairfield County (Westport / Wilton / Easton / Pound Ridge). All sections are formatted for direct reuse in decks, outreach, and low-code site builders.

**Origin & Dedication:** The foundational community vision for this initiative is credited to Sgt. Brandon N. Mohamed of New York, whose articulation of social and emotional development needs—and his Kingston, NY vacant mall reimagining—sparked this shared pursuit of greater public welfare and expanded social opportunity. In alignment with his vision, this document is dedicated to keeping the avenues of inspiration open so that contributors can access, adapt, and invest in every derivative, iteration, and collaborative pathway, celebrating each person as a vital pixel in the larger immersive imagination that brings these projects to life.

## One-Page Investment Memo

**Childcare + Enrichment Village — Fairfield County (Westport / Wilton / Easton / Pound Ridge)**

**Founder:** Allison Van Cura — choreographer, educator, systems designer. Pilot operator with local traction and a tech-enabled trust stack (digital-notary + “Sentient Cents” scholarship ledger).

**Opportunity (30s):**
Affluent towns with high parental labor-force participation face a severe shortage of licensed infant/toddler & integrated enrichment care. Real estate is expensive; staffing and regulation create frictions. We create a mission-owned campus (nonprofit owns land/buildings) with a for-profit operator running a licensed childcare village + dance studio + STEAM labs + farm that lowers family costs via bulk purchasing, volunteer crediting, and scholarship micro-ledgers.

**Model:**

- Revenue: tuition, enrichment classes, studio rentals, CSA/retail, corporate employer slots, events.
- Social engine: _Sentient Cents_ credits volunteer/in-kind contributions into tuition credits and audited scholarships (run via nonprofit).
- Legal: Nonprofit owns property; operator leases & licenses IP (recurring license fee). This preserves mission and attracts grants/low-cost capital.

**Traction:**

- Founding-family waitlist: _[insert number]_ (pilot conversion demonstrated).
- Pilot (studio/aftercare): occupancy, NPS, and revenue metrics (available on request).
- IP: Notarization protocol, intake UX, Sentient Cents ledger prototype.

**Uses of funds (ask):** **$1,250,000** (example target) — acquire & renovate 2–3 acre site + buildout + 12 months operating cushion + scholarship seed + sensors/tech. Scalable asks available ($350k pilot → $2.5M village).

**Use of Proceeds (example $1.25M):**

- Property deposit & acquisition: $700k
- Renovation & playground/farmscaping: $250k
- Licensing/building compliance & engineering: $60k
- Operating cushion (12 months): $160k
- Scholarship seed & Sentient Cents admin: $30k

**Financial snapshot (3yr):** Target breakeven 18–30 months; stabilized margins 18–28%; projected NOI grows with add-on programming and studio rentals. (Detailed pro-forma attached/available.)

**Impact metrics:** capacity 120 children; 15% scholarship slots year 1; measurable early-learning outcome score improvements; parental workforce participation gains.

**Risks & mitigants:** zoning pushback (community outreach + pre-apps), staffing shortages (apprentice pipeline + competitive pay & benefits), capex surprise (survey/Phase I required prior to close).

**Exit & Return (impact):** For impact investors: blended social ROI + steady cashflows; for property investors: long-term lease to operator; nonprofit stewardship mitigates mission drift.

**Next steps:** LOI + Option on site; seed close to fund surveys + permits. Contact: Allison Van Cura — [acfwrites@gmail.com](mailto:acfwrites@gmail.com) — (###) ###-####
