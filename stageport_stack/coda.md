# Coda: On Chairs That Remember

The old studios ran on memory that lived inside people—
in teachers’ knees, in mothers’ calendars, in exhausted notebooks.
When those bodies left, the record vanished.

StagePort refuses that erasure.
A single chair—lit by a phone screen—now holds the ledger
for every leap, every twinge, every scholarship, every “not yet.”

The system does not replace the humans;
it catches the proof of their care before it falls through the floor.

Motion becomes structure.
Structure becomes witness.
Witness becomes law.
