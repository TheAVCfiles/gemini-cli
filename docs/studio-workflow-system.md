# Studio Workflow System

This guide turns a creative studio into a predictable production pipeline. Use the four-phase formula, Gantt skeleton, and ready-to-fill templates to keep inputs, processing, production, and outputs separate while moving everything forward with clear dependencies.

## Master Workflow Formula

Move work through the same loop every time so you never mix phases:

```
INPUT → PROCESS → PRODUCE → OUTPUT → ARCHIVE → ITERATE
```

- **Input:** Capture raw ideas, drafts, notes, recordings, screenshots, receipts, and references without editing.
- **Process:** Organize and tag inputs, break them into nodes or components, and outline the work.
- **Produce:** Write, design, code, and assemble modules without switching back to processing.
- **Output:** Export PDFs, decks, posts, UX flows, prototypes, or episodes.
- **Archive:** Store assets and decisions for reuse.
- **Iterate:** Feed new learnings back into inputs for the next pass.

## Gantt Diagram & Dependencies Engine

Apply the same five-phase spine to each macro-project (Decrypt the Girl, Daughtercode, Intuition Labs, Sojourner Network, MythOS) and plug it into Notion, Sheets, Asana, ClickUp, or a PDF dashboard.

| Phase | Focus | Example Tasks | Dependencies | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Foundation | IP definition, system diagrams, provisional patent, glossary, studio dashboard | Create IP dossier, draft glossary, capture diagrams | None | IP dossier, PDF decks |
| Architecture | UX mode maps, node trees, episode arcs, glyph system | Build Mermaid diagrams, map nodes, outline arcs | Foundation | Architecture deck |
| Execution | Pages written, episodes drafted, decks built, code prototypes | Draft scripts, assemble decks, prototype modules | Architecture | MVP prototypes |
| Production | KDP version, web app V1, lesson plans, Decryption Deck PDF | Package publishing versions, polish UX, finalize assets | Execution | Consumer-facing artifacts |
| Distribution | Reels, Threads, newsletter, press deck | Cut social clips, prep launch comms, publish newsletter | Production | Launch package |

## Roadmap Templates & Forms

Use these repeatable templates to keep the pipeline guided.

### 90-Day Roadmap Template

- **Goal:** _What is the main output?_
- **3 Priorities:**
  1. _Priority 1_
  2. _Priority 2_
  3. _Priority 3_

| Phase | What | Deadline | Dependency | Done? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | IP | mm/dd | None | [] |
| 2 | Architecture | mm/dd | 1 | [] |
| 3 | Execution | mm/dd | 2 | [] |
| 4 | Production | mm/dd | 3 | [] |
| 5 | Distribution | mm/dd | 4 | [] |

### Weekly Ship Sheet

- **What I will ship this week (top 3):** 1) ____, 2) ____, 3) ____
- **What blocks me:** ____
- **What I need clarity on:** ____
- **What I will archive or eliminate:** ____
- **What I’m shipping next week:** ____

### Module Creation Form

Use this once per component (episode, deck, tool, PDF) to make work replicable.

- **Module name:** ____
- **Inputs:** raw content, references, assets
- **Process:** break into 3–5 pieces or nodes
- **Production:** what gets written, designed, or coded
- **Output:** format, publish location, who needs the link
- **Archive:** where assets and decisions go

## Generative Loop

Run every project as a closed loop so nothing stalls:

1. **Collect:** ideas, voice notes, stories, memories, screenshots, drafts
2. **Condense:** turn them into nodes, modules, scenes, cards
3. **Convert:** turn modules into PDFs, decks, scripts, apps, or lessons
4. **Cashflow:** turn outputs into books, classes, subscriptions, licensing, or IP deals

## Ready-to-Generate Assets

Pick one or more to instantiate in your tools of choice:

1. Gantt chart PDF (five macro-projects, five phases)
2. Notion dashboard template with the workflow loop and forms
3. Google Sheets roadmap with dependencies and auto-coloring
4. Project pipeline PDF bundling all templates
5. One-button weekly system (prefilled weekly sheet)
6. Generative Loop canvas (creative-to-cashflow on one page)

Use the Master Workflow Formula as the brain, the Gantt spine as the skeleton, the templates as the organs, and the Generative Loop as the circulatory system. Separate processing from production, and the studio stays fast, predictable, and mythically precise.
