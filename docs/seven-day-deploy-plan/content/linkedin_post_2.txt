LinkedIn Post #2 · Balanchine Cipher

Day 5 of the Adaptive Ethics launch ballet = translation day. The "Balanchine Cipher" is how we take the provenance spine and translate it into language partners and press care about.

What changed today:
• Press kit starter went live with executive summary + talking points.
• Linked the DOI page, canonical PDF, and Zenodo record so every journalist lands on the source of truth.
• Sent soft-touch notes to a short list of analysts asking for a readiness scan.

This isn’t just PR. It's choreography that keeps compliance, communications, and sales in one tempo. Want to see the press kit template? Request the "Cipher" walkthrough at https://YOURDOMAIN.tld/press/.
