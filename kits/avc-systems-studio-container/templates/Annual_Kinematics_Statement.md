## Section 1 — Value Generated (Motion, Not Money)
Category | Units Logged | Conversion Basis
--- | --- | ---
Rehearsal / Teaching Hours | 412 hrs | Time × Load
Care / Coordination | 187 units | Presence Index
System Design / IP | 9 artifacts | Ledger weight

This table proves labor without monetizing the body.

## Section 2 — Sentient Cents Issued
Metric | Amount
--- | ---
Sentient Cents Issued | 8,940 SC
SC Converted to USD | 3,250 USD
SC Held (Unconverted) | 5,690 SC
SC Donated / Allocated | 1,200 SC

> Sentient Cents represent ledger-verified kinematic value. Conversion is optional and event-triggered.

---

## Section 3 — Tax Treatment (boring = safe)
- Converted SC → USD → report as self-employment income (1099 / Schedule C).
- Unconverted SC → internal ledger credits, non-taxable until conversion.
- Donated SC → eligible for charitable allocation if routed through 501(c)(3).

This mirrors airline miles, store credits, or grant drawdowns — no novelty, no audit magnet.

---

## Section 4 — Audit & Verification
- Ledger maintained locally; entries are append-only.
- Statement derived from time logs, event records, and artifact hashes.
- Verification available via record ID.

> This statement asserts no valuation claims beyond logged conversions.
