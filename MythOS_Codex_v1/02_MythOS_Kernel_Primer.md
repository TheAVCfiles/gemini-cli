# MythOS Kernel – Signal → Structure → Sovereignty

## Section 1 – Origin: The Girl and the Gate

Before engines and ledgers, there was the **body**:
- The ballet body.
- The survivor body.
- The archetypal body.

Decrypt the Girl formalizes what dancers already know:  
**movement is memory language.** Turnout becomes alignment, tendu becomes proof, arabesque becomes vector, collapse becomes payload, rise becomes computation.

## Section 2 – The Glitch as God Particle

In MythOS:

- A collapse = a commit.
- A deviation = a data packet.
- A stumble = a story artifact.
- A freeze = a signal node.

Nothing is wasted. Nothing is shame. Everything is information.  
The glitch is not the interruption – **it is the intelligence**.

## Section 3 – Ritual Triad (Surface → Cipher → Echo)

- **Surface** – Screenshots, transcripts, scenes, reels. What the world sees.
- **Cipher** – Engines, ledgers, timings, grammars, somatic logs.
- **Echo** – IP licensing, prosperity, legacy, systemic change.

Every subsystem in this codex re-enters this triad. This is the **mini-constitution** for each feature.

## Section 4 – Dual Signal Doctrine

- **Signal One** – The wound.
- **Signal Two** – The wisdom.

Most systems pick one. MythOS holds both as a single computational continuum.  
Duality becomes doctrine. Doctrine becomes dynasty.

## Section 5 – Kernel Equation

**Signal → Structure → Sovereignty**

This kernel drives:
- The Physics Engine (DeepScorer / Py.rouette)
- StagePort Execution Stack
- Sovereign Ledger
- StageCred
- The 12-Dimension Stack

This is your E = mc².
