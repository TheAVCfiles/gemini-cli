# MWRA Interactive Glossary

A lightweight, AI-assisted glossary UI for MWRA terminology. The site ships with a
canonical `glossary.json`, offers CSV/JSON ingest, flags conflicts, and exposes an
optional `/ask` endpoint for AI-assisted explanations.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Canonical glossary preloaded from `web/glossary.json`
- Zero-build Netlify deployment with `/netlify/functions/ask`
- CSV/JSON ingest with conflict detection against the bundled dataset
- Alphabet navigation (Aâ€“Z / #) and instant search
- Export currently visible entries as CSV
- Optional OpenAI-backed assistant (falls back to offline stub)

## ðŸ”§ Quickstart (Netlify)

1. Fork or clone this repository and push it to your Git provider.
2. In Netlify, choose **New site from Git** and connect the repository.
3. Use these build settings:
   - **Build command:** leave empty (static site)
   - **Publish directory:** `web`
   - **Functions directory:** `netlify/functions`
4. (Optional) Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` under **Site settings â†’ Environment variables**.
5. Deploy. The site will load `web/glossary.json` and the UI will call
   `/.netlify/functions/ask` when the assistant dialog is used.

âœ… Without an API key the function returns a stub response so the UI remains usable.

---

## ðŸ›  Local development

```bash
npm install
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify dev
```

This serves the static site at `http://localhost:8888` and proxies `/.netlify/functions/ask`.
If you prefer not to use Netlify CLI, you can run any static server from the `web`
directory and point API calls to a deployed instance.

## ðŸ“˜ Glossary data

- `web/glossary.json` contains the canonical MWRA terminology (sample of 30 entries).
- `web/boot_glossary.js` fetches the JSON, renders the UI, and handles ingest/export.
- Uploading a CSV/JSON file overlays an external dataset so the conflict agent can
  highlight new, changed, or missing terms.

**CSV format** (extra columns are ignored):

```text
term,definition,sources
Abutment,Part of a structure supporting an arch or span,MWRA SpecBook
```

**JSON format**: array of objects with `term`, `definition`, and optional `sources`.

## ðŸ¤– Ask endpoint

`netlify/functions/ask.js` wraps OpenAI's Responses API. Provide an `OPENAI_API_KEY`
to enable live answers. Without the key, the function echoes a stub message so the
frontend experience stays consistent.

Environment variables:

| Variable         | Description                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | (Optional) API key for OpenAI Responses API              |
| `OPENAI_MODEL`   | (Optional) Override the model. Default: `gpt-4o-mini`    |

## âœ… Maintenance checklist

- Update `web/glossary.json` as terminology evolves.
- Re-run an ingest check with the Conflict Agent before publishing.
- Redeploy on Netlify after updating the dataset or UI.
- Rotate API keys and store them only in Netlify/GCF environment variables.
