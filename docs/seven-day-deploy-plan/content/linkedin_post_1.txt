LinkedIn Post #1 · Temperance

Today I shipped the Adaptive Ethics Secure Edition: a seven-day launch ballet that keeps provenance, compliance, and revenue signals in the same frame.

Day 1 is about temperance—slow enough to anchor the DOI and JSON-LD correctly, fast enough to deploy the Cloudflare Pages site before momentum cools. The bundle includes:
• DOI landing page with schema markup
• Compliance intake shell ready for your Typeform or Notion embed
• Echo Edition one-pager for high-fit follow-ups
• Three LinkedIn posts (including this one) to narrate the arc

If you want the librarian bundle (checklists, calendar, and site scaffold), drop "Temperance" below or visit https://YOURDOMAIN.tld/scan/ and I'll send it across.
