# Seven Day Deploy Plan

This directory reproduces the "librarian" bundle for launching **Adaptive Ethics Vol. 1 (Secure Edition)** in seven days. It includes:

- **Checklists & calendar** (`checklists/`, `Seven_Day_Launch_Ballet.ics`) for daily execution.
- **Deployable site scaffold** (`site/`) for Cloudflare Pages with DOI, press, compliance, and Echo Edition views.
- **Content blocks** (`content/`) covering JSON-LD, abstract copy, and three LinkedIn posts.
- **Assets folder** (`assets/`) with instructions for storing the canonical PDF and metadata exports.

Follow `index.html` in this directory for a guided overview of every artifact.
