# 12-Dimension Stack (Director Console View)

Anchor motto: **Clarity is Couture.**  
“We engineer the infrastructure of grace. Where embodied intelligence meets sovereign code.”

1. **Authority Layer** – UAL, amendment log, faculty roster, escalation map.
2. **Identity** – wallets, consent artifacts, guardian signatures, revocation hooks.
3. **Ingestion** – sensors, uploads, transcripts, manual spot checks, provenance hashes.
4. **Physics** – DeepScorer + Py.rouette models, calibration sets, versioned weights.
5. **Integrity** – anomaly detection, stability index, confidence bands, glitch capture.
6. **Ledger** – Sovereign Ledger, token mint/burn, revenue share splits, audit trails.
7. **Credentials** – StageCred issuances, badges, revocation notices, portability schema.
8. **Narrative** – canon statements, corridor calls, public-safe excerpts, embargo rules.
9. **Interfaces** – Director’s Chair, StageCred portal, API gateway, skin registry.
10. **Safety** – Title IX exports, redaction toolkit, duty-of-care timers, panic stops.
11. **Economics** – scholarship routing, investor reports, cohort ROI, treasury policy.
12. **Memory** – archives, story diagrams, motion-to-proof timelines, exhibit bundles.

Each dimension is addressable via config and version tags.  
No dimension may be deployed without referencing the UAL and the Consent/Identity layer.
