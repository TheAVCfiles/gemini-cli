# APop Allstars: KPop Kinetics Curriculum (Dancer Edition)

APop Allstars immerses movers ages 6–12 in KPop-inspired choreography while building emotional intelligence and creative data literacy. Learners translate movement into trackable signals, collaborating like an idol team while reflecting on how music, mood, and metrics combine to drive compelling performances.

## Learning goals

- **Rhythmic intelligence:** Synchronize with tempo shifts and beat patterns through iterative choreography drills.
- **Emotional expression:** Interpret core feelings—joy, sadness, excitement, calm—and communicate them through posture, gesture, and facial storytelling.
- **Creative data literacy:** Encode choreography sequences using the Kinetic Cipher, connecting movement phrases to symbols, counts, and feedback loops.
- **Team confidence:** Practice stage presence, group unity, and supportive coaching habits that mirror professional idol groups.
- **Production mindset:** Design mini-performances with lighting, formations, and intentional narrative arcs.

## Participant profile

- Ideal for dancers, movers, and KPop enthusiasts ages 6–12.
- Works best with 12–18 learners plus one lead facilitator (Miss Allison Van Cura) and a rotating assistant.
- Requires a studio or multi-purpose room with mirrors, soft flooring, and projection or tablet support.
