# The Anaretic Edge — Lilly’s 29° Protocol

## Daily Rules

1. **Morning Check** — Review `composite_score` for today plus prior 10 days. If any `red` within the last seven days → trigger triage.
2. **Triage Pause** — No public launches, signatures, or irreversible action until triage clears.
3. **Guardian Protect** — Activate Guardian check-in (Aura Mode, low visibility).
4. **Prepare (24–72 hrs)** — Rehearse, gather documentation, consult legal and mentor.
5. **Urgent Legal/Funding** — Escalate to external counsel; do not sign within 48 hours.

## After Red Clears

6. **Debrief (15 minutes)** — Capture triggers, Guardian flow performance, and update Notion log.

## Weekly Rhythm

7. **Capacity Check (60 minutes)** — With Allison or core mentor.
8. **Mentor Hour Cap** — Limit mentoring hours to protect nervous system bandwidth.
