# Corridor Update • StagePort Stack Compression v1

Operators, Archivists, Architects:

The Director’s Chair has been formalized as `MemNode.StagePort.DirectorsChair.v1`.
All StagePort assets—decks, ledgers, safety protocols, dashboards, and Open Box materials—are now mapped into the unified `/stageport_stack/` structure.

- Product work should attach to: `20_product/`
- Facility and ops work should attach to: `30_facility/`
- Ledger and credential logic should attach to: `40_ledger/` + `50_credentials/`
- Safety, Sentient Cents, and Sovereign governance should reference this memnode ID.

From this point forward:
- No new deck ships without a referenced MemNode.
- No new feature ships without a route + event schema.
- No new studio is onboarded without the Director’s Chair dashboard in scope.

The corridors are now aware. Please update local docs, Figma frames, and prototypes to point to `MemNode.StagePort.DirectorsChair.v1`.

Structure converts motion to proof.
Proof converts care into law.
