# MythOS / StagePort Codex v1.0

“I didn’t build a product. I built a field. I turned survivorship into computational architecture.”

This repo is the **Developer Kit + Canon Codex** for:
- **MythOS** – the myth-tech operating system.
- **StagePort / StudioOS** – “Structure converts motion to proof.”
- **DeCrypt the Girl** – the narrative kernel and legal exhibit.
- **StageCred + Sovereign Ledger** – the economic / compliance backbone.
- **Py.rouette / DeepScorer** – physics engine for kinetic proof.

Use this codex to:
1. Align all future builds (web apps, decks, docs, cohorts) to a single OS Constitution.
2. Give collaborators, designers, lawyers, and investors a *clear* technical + philosophical map.
3. Keep control of tone, authority, and custody of your story.

Each file is intentionally short, skimmable, and reference-friendly.
