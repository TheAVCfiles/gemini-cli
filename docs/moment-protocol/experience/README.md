# MomentProtocol_EXPERIENCE_v2 (REVELATION)

Purpose: show how the system feels to move through—for studio owners, tweens, parents, and survivors.

## Folder outline
- `README.md` — framing and emotional contract.
- `01_journeys/` — journey maps for studio owner, tween dancer, parent, FoundHerLab survivor.
- `02_blueprint_boxes/` — launch box, tween leadership box, sentinel ethics box (Adaptive Ethics Vol.1 facilitation).
- `03_interfaces/` — Notion dashboard screens, MWRA MVP views, student portal samples.
- `04_communications/` — email sequences, SMS prompts, in-class scripts with Moment Protocol tone.
- `05_storyworlds/` — Velvet Interface fragments, Evidence Vault prompts, narrative overlays.

## Experience principles
- Every participant can point to their promised moment; the portal mirrors the casting contract.
- Communications stay clear and emotionally literate—no fawning, no ambiguity about expectations.
- Blueprint boxes act like staircases: followable sequences that lead to a show-ready protocol deployment.
