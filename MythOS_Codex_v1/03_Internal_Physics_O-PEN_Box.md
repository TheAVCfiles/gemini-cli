```

- **Movement / Somatic Integrity** – sensor logs, kinematic traces, injury flags, fatigue.
- **Money / Market Timing** – tuition flows, scholarships, volatility, campaign response.
- **Memory / Narrative Casting** – media events, transcripts, contracts, public perception.

O:PEN Box turns chaotic lived input into structured proof objects:
- Scores
- Risk snapshots
- Credentials
- Narrative diagrams
