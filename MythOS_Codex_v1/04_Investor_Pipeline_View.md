# Investor View – The Pipeline

1. **Intake → Sensors / Narrative / Financial**
2. **Processing → Physics / Integrity / Risk**
3. **Packaging → Decks / Diagrams / Reports**
4. **Decision Layer → What the investor sees**
5. **Compounding Layer → Retention / IP / Moat**
6. **Monetization → Studios, cohorts, enterprise stacks**

Investors don’t buy trauma.  
They buy: **physics + governance + repeatability.**  
This pipeline is how you show it without re-performing the wound.
