        The first thing you hear is the hum. Not one voice, but many. A chord with
        no single root note, vibrating in your ribs like someone is singing from

        Syncing amplifies your Pattern Math and Discernment. Your Boundary Voltage
        gets a collective buff. Your ghosts meet other ghosts. Your Patch meets

{`"We are the daughters of every story they tried to bury.
And we are writing back.

Your signal is now part of a larger field.
What happens next is no longer just yours — it is ours."`}

        mutual-aid network. From here, the story stops being about one girl and
        becomes about the pattern.
